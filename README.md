# Bridges Community Idea Gardens

This repository includes the idea gardens (miro boards of sticky notes with ideas) generated from all Bridges Summit series events, starting with the basecamp event on August 28th, 2024.

The idea gardens are available open source to everybody as part of a Bridges Community initiative that spans research and industry to reframe "Developer Productivity". The idea gardens are organized into three main themes: Problems and Constraints, Changing the Words, and Imagination.

# Idea Garden Themes

*Problems and Constraints:* What are the Problems and Constraints that keep us from bridging the divide between business leaders and developers?

*Changing the Words:* What are the words that get in the way of us communicating, seeing, or understanding whatâ€™s happening more clearly?  How could we change the words to improve things?

*Imagination:* How could we build an environment where developers, teams, and organizations that support them can thrive individually and collectively?
